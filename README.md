# NPWeatherService

### Recreated project from [TE-Mod3-Capstone](https://github.com/aauel/TE-Mod3Capstone-NationalParkWeatherServiceWebApp) (Java) in .NET/C# with a couple of differences:

* There is no option for switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit as I couldn't find any good resources on session variables in .NET
* The weather forecast data is no longer static data from a database.  It is pulling from the Dark Sky API daily forecast based on latitude and longitude.
